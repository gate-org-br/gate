		<strong>&lt;g-form-view&gt;</strong> Element:

		The <strong>&lt;g-form-view&gt;</strong> element is a crucial component in the form management system, designed to visually present and display the content of a form created and modified through the <strong>&lt;g-form&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;g-form-editor&gt;</strong> elements.

		Upon receiving a <a target='_blank' href="/component/form/form.json">JSON representation of a form</a>, the <strong>&lt;g-form-view&gt;</strong> element interprets and renders the form fields as specified in the JSON structure. Unlike the editing interface provided by <strong>&lt;g-form&gt;</strong>, the primary purpose of <strong>&lt;g-form-view&gt;</strong> is to showcase the finalized or current state of the form to end-users.

		The user interface generated by <strong>&lt;g-form-view&gt;</strong> reflects the configured form fields, displaying their names, input types, and any predefined options. Users can view the form layout and data without the ability to modify the content, ensuring a clear and non-editable representation.

		Additionally, <strong>&lt;g-form-view&gt;</strong> facilitates a responsive and user-friendly presentation, adapting to the specified column layouts and handling diverse form elements, including text inputs, date pickers, dropdowns, and multi-select options.

		In summary, the <strong>&lt;g-form-view&gt;</strong> element provides a read-only, visually appealing representation of a form based on the provided JSON structure. Its role is crucial in delivering a finalized form presentation to end-users while ensuring a consistent and intuitive display of the form's content.
