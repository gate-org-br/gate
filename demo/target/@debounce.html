	<h1>@debounce</h1>
	<p>
		Debouncing, a programming practice to optimize system performance, is particularly useful in scenarios
		where time-consuming tasks need controlled execution frequencies. In user interfaces and event handling,
		the <strong>@debounce</strong> mechanism serves to limit how often a function is called within a specified
		time interval. Essential parameters for this process include a timeout duration and a piped trigger.
		The <strong>@debounce</strong> ensures that its associated trigger executes only after the trigger event
		has ceased for the specified timeout, preventing unnecessary or premature function calls. Users can conveniently
		pass these required parameters in any order, providing flexibility and customization options for tailoring the
		debounce behavior to specific application needs.

			In this example, the <strong>@debounce</strong> mechanism plays a crucial role in optimizing user input handling.
			It ensures that the associated <strong>@JSONtoHTML</strong> trigger activates only one second after the user stops
			inputting data.
