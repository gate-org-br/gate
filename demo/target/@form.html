		Retrieve the form description from the server, present it to the user for editing,
		and subsequently trigger another action with the edited result. The target trigger
		should be specified as the first parameter, followed by optional parameters for the
		HTTP method and action in any order. If the method is not provided, it defaults
		to <strong>'post'</strong>. If the action is not provided, it defaults to the original
		action.

		<p>
			On this example, the @form trigger fetches the <a href="/form.json" target='_blank'>form.json</a>
			file from the server using the HTTP get method and presents it's as a form to be edited
			by the user. Upon edition, the edited form is piped to the @request trigger. The request
			trigger makes a HTTP post with the edited form to the same action of the @form trigger and
			pipe the result to the property trigger. The property trigger updates it's target value
			property with the edited form.
