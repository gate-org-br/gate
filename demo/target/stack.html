			The <strong>@push</strong>, <strong>@pull</strong>, and <strong>@free</strong> triggers are essential
			elements of the content stack functionality, contributing to streamlined server request handling.
			The content stack acts as a repository for storing inner HTML, reducing redundant server requests.
			Upon activation, the <strong>@push</strong> trigger strategically
			preserves the inner HTML of the designated trigger element on the stack before initiating the request.
			Subsequently, the <strong>@pull</strong> trigger examines the content stack, extracting stored content if present,
			and utilizing it as the action for the target trigger. If the stack is empty, the <strong>@pull</strong> trigger
			seamlessly forwards the request unaltered. Additionally, the <strong>@free</strong> trigger plays a crucial role
			by clearing the content stack before passing the request unaltered. This comprehensive system optimizes
			efficiency by judiciously managing inner HTML content and enhancing the overall handling of server requests.

					In this example, pressing the Push button triggers the <strong>@push</strong> operation,
					causing the inner HTML of the specified target element to be consistently
					pushed onto the content stack. Notably, the Push button is part of the loaded
					content, and it serves the additional function of rolling back the content
					from the stack. This setup ensures that each press of the Push button not only
					updates the stack with the current inner HTML but also provides a mechanism to
					revert to previously stored content by leveraging the stack functionality.
